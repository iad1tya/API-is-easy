## How can I contribute to documentation?

We use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for documentation. The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the source files for the website live in the `docs` directory of this repository.

To contribute to documentation:

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Make your changes to the files in the `docs` directory.
3.  Run `npm run start` to start a local development server and preview your changes.
4.  Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
5.  Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

## Found a typo?

You can open an issue, but it's easier to just edit the file and submit a pull request.

## Want to contribute new code?

### Important: We're using Conventional Commits
